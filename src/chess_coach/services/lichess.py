"""Lichess Opening Explorer client.

The Opening Explorer aggregates millions of games and, for a given position,
returns the moves that have actually been played together with their win/draw/
loss statistics and the name of the opening. It is the agent's source of
*theoretical* moves.

The public Explorer endpoint (``https://explorer.lichess.ovh``) needs no
authentication. We only ever issue one request at a time and always pass an
explicit timeout, as recommended by the Lichess API guidelines.
