"""Lichess Opening Explorer client.

The Opening Explorer answers, for a given position, with the moves that have
actually been played, their win/draw/loss statistics, the name of the opening,
and a handful of reference games. It is the agent's source of *theoretical*
moves and of the reference games shown beside them.

Two databases are available. ``lichess`` aggregates every rated game played on
the site — hundreds of millions, including a lot of beginner improvisation —
while ``masters`` only holds over-the-board master games. We query ``masters``:
those are the reference games, and their much smaller volume is what lets us
tell a studied line apart from a position nobody plays.

The endpoint requires an authenticated request; a personal Lichess token
(no scope needed) is read from ``LICHESS_TOKEN``. Requests are issued one at a
time with an explicit timeout, as the Lichess API guidelines ask.
